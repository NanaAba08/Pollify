# Features
- Users can select one option out of multiple options.
- Voting results are displayed dynamically.
- Each option's percentage of total votes is calculated and visually represented with a colored bar.
- User-friendly interface with intuitive radio buttons for selection and a submit button to finalize the vote.
- Error handling prompts users to make a selection if they forget to select an option before submitting.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Technologies Used
- HTML: HyperText Markup Language for structuring the content and layout of the web page.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the HTML elements.
- JavaScript: Adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web page.
- DOM: Document Object Model manipulated using JavaScript.
- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: Next-generation front-end tooling for modern web development.
