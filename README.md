WEBSTACK PORTFOLIO PROJECT - POLLIFY

PORTFOLIO PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project is a simple web-based polling application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The layout is centered within the viewport and styled with a clean and modern aesthetic. The main functionality allows users to vote for one option out of many options
Upon selecting an option and submitting their vote, the application dynamically updates to display the voting results. Each option's percentage of total votes is calculated and represented visually with a colored bar, while the exact percentage is displayed alongside it.
The interface is user-friendly, with intuitive radio buttons for selection and a submit button to finalize the vote. Additionally, if a user forgets to select an option before submitting, an alert prompts them to make a selection before proceeding.
Overall, this polling application provides a straightforward way to gather and visualize voting data in real-time, making it suitable for various online surveys or feedback gathering purposes.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
HTML and CSS Fundamentals: Gain a solid understanding of structuring web pages using HTML and styling them using CSS, including layout positioning, background colors, font styles, and element alignment.
JavaScript Interactivity: Learn how to add interactivity to web pages using JavaScript, including handling user events such as button clicks and radio button selections.
DOM Manipulation: Understand the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manipulate HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript, such as creating, modifying, and removing elements based on user actions.
CSS Animations and Transitions: Explore CSS animations and transitions to add visual effects to web elements, such as the animation applied to the poll container when it appears on the screen.
Event Handling: Practice event handling in JavaScript, including attaching event listeners to DOM elements and responding to user interactions like submitting a vote.
Data Management: Learn how to manage and manipulate data structures in JavaScript, such as arrays of objects representing the poll options and their respective vote counts.
Dynamic Content Updating: Understand how to update the content of web pages dynamically based on user input or changes in data, as demonstrated by the real-time update of voting results after submitting a vote.
Responsive Design: Gain experience in creating responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience across platforms.
Error Handling: Practice implementing error handling mechanisms, such as alerting users when they forget to select an option before submitting their vote.
Percentage Calculation: Learn how to calculate percentages based on numerical data, as demonstrated by calculating the percentage of votes for each poll option and displaying them graphically.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Used for structuring the content and layout of the web page.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Utilized for styling the HTML elements, including setting colors, fonts, margins, padding, and animations.
JavaScript: Employed for adding interactivity to the web page, handling user events such as button clicks, updating the DOM dynamically, and performing calculations for displaying voting results.
DOM (Document Object Model): Manipulated using JavaScript to interact with and modify the HTML elements dynamically, such as creating new elements, updating their attributes, and appending them to the DOM.
